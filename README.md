# CV

Please take a look in my CV I made with the great ... package using Rmarkdown in the following [link](https://rawcdn.githack.com/elior631/CV/bc2b04ca312c299468a2d09658bd01e54e95744f/HTML%20resume/html-resume.html)

Feel free to use the tamplate on the [html resume folder](https://github.com/elior631/CV/tree/master/HTML%20resume)

Enjoy
